# First Post!

Hello, and welcome to my website. Here is where I will put things like discussions of projects I am working on, what I am learning about, and personal opinions on data science, math, or whatever I feel like talking about.

Something really cool about this format is that in addition to the usual markup formatting, we can create code chunks.  Here's python code:

```python
def welcome():
	print("Hello Everyone!")
```

And some R code:

```r
library(tidyverse)

lin.model <- lm(y~x, data=some.data)
```

We can do inline code like this: `print(x+y)`. 

We can also make nice math symbols: $$ \int_{\mathcal{M}}K dA = 2 \pi \chi(\mathcal{M})  $$. We can also put math on a new line:

\begin{equation}
\int_{D}d\omega = \int_{\partial D}\omega 
\end{equation}
