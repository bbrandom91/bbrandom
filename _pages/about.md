Hi! My name is Brett and I am a data scientist. I'm passionate about using the power of data to help businesses and make the world a better place. As a math nerd, I also find the technical aspects of doing data science to be fun and engaging. I especially love developing machine learning models and performing statistical analysis to produce actionable insights from data.
